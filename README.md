# React 
- root component will have many components which will create a hierarchy
- custom components should start with uppercase letter as all html components are small case like div, image, etc
- we use {} to output value dynamically we can also store path in a variable and output

## Props
- we can set props("custom attributes") on components to then extract and use them in the receiving component
- we use props to send values to a functions and these values are sent as a key value pair
- if we want to create multiple components with same component structure this can be used
